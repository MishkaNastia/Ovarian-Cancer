    "# Flux comparison\n",
    "In FIG. 4 , the authors compared subsystems by selecting the most de-regulated reactions across cell types (LG and HG). I think They optimized to max biomass each of the 7 models  (they generated 7 FBA solutions) and then they computed the average of each flux across cell lines of the same family.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they selected one of the many solutions that respect max biomass growth. I suggest to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Impose biomass at its upper bound for each model (LB = UB*0.90 to avoid solver numerical issues)\n",
    "2. Run flux sampling with OPTGP (cobrapy) with thinning = 100 and 1k samples per cell line\n",
    "3. DO not 'summarize' flux probability distributions with a simple average, but use more advanced methods. The objective here is to identify the most different reactions across the two cancer families. You could run non parametric statistical tests such as mann-whitney to check if two probability distributions are significantly different or not. You have 3 cells vs 2 cells (all pair combinations), so you could perform this test only on reactions belonging to core subsystems such as glycolysis, TCA cycle pentophosphate etc.. in order to redure the number of compared distribution per cell couple.\n",
    "4. Once you identified the top-n most different probability distributions (reaction fluxes) across cells of different type, you could plot them with boxplots as the authors did \n",
    "5. It might be interesting to check if we have 'less differences' in distributions of cells belonging to the same family."
